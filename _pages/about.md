Hi! My name is Zac Pentecos. I am curious mathematician/ physicists with knowledge in numerous computational languages
and methods in regard to science - particularly modeling and solving mathematical and physical problems. I am currently researching and modeling COVID predicting the health outcomes of the Queensland population with the introduction of
covid variants and medical interventions. 




<!-- Since October 2021, I am a PhD student with the Clinical Brain Network and Brain Modelling groups at QIMR Berghofer. I am researching how activity in the brain can be described with physics-based models, with aims of describing pathology and treatments with non-invasive stimulation techniques. 

Previous to this, I completed my Bachelor of Advanced Science degree at the University of Queensland where I undertook a wide variety of research projects in laser physics, machine learning, critical phenomena and neuroscience. 

I have been tutoring a variety of subjects at the University of Queensland since 2019. This includes practical laboratories and coding along with more traditional mathematics and physics classes. My approach is to deliver the content with passion and inspire students to engage with their studies.

An example of my current work on cortical eigenmodes is below:
